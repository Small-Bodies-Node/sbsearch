# sbsearch
Search for specific small Solar System bodies in astronomical surveys.

`sbsearch` is designed for efficient searching of large amounts of wide-field data.  The guiding principle is to execute a fast and approximate search to narrow down the list of images and objects needed for a more-precise search.   The search is based on ephemerides from the Minor Planet Center or JPL Horizons.  Ephemerides for objects commonly searched for can be stored and re-used.

## Status

2018 Nov 28: `sbsearch` is functional, but in development and therefore the API can still change.
